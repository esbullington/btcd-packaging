# btcd packaging
Signed btcd apt repository and signed tarballs.

----
There doesn't seem to be much interest in a signed btcd repo for apt.  So I've taken down the apt repo, and and signed binaries.  However, if anyone is using this and would be interested in me updating it to the latest version of btcd and perhaps even automating the process so I could build and sign btcd nightlies, please let me know if this repo's issues.
